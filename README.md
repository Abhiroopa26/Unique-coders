# Backpropagation for Neural Network

This Python script implements a simple neural network using backpropagation to predict outputs based on input features.

## Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Dataset**: Prepare your dataset in a suitable format. Ensure it is properly preprocessed and split into training and test sets.

3. **Running the Script**:
   
   - Adjust the filename in the code if your dataset has a different name.
   - Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter.

   ```bash
   python backpropagation_neural_network.py
